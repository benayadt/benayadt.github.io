I am a Software Engineer with over 12 years of experience in building and delivering robust software solutions across finance and cloud computing domains.

I spent 9 years at Murex, where I specialized in financial technology solutions, working on mission-critical systems for the banking and trading industry. Since 2023, I have been contributing to Amazon Web Services (AWS), focusing on cloud infrastructure and services at scale.
